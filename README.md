1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs  
2. Create the divs using JavaScript… don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your html file!  
3. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.  
4. Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad.  
5. You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used  
6. (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
